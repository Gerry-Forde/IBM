# Structure

Keep sentences short, 25 words or fewer. Emphasize important points with the occasional short sentence (fewer than 10 words).

If your docs are aimed at helping `people` code, then probably that "previous developer experience" is a good way to go, preferably with details on the specific languages/environments they'll be writing about.
